FIX SORTING

    When I receive back json data from API I am just adding each one to the store by id,
    and then sorting the whole thing.

    Instead keep a store variable for sortedFeed that way I can return the new subreddit feed from createFeedObjects and sort ONLY JUST THAT.

    Since the rest of the feed from all the previous subreddits is already sorted. I just have to sort the new one,
    then I have 2 sorted arrays (sortedFeed, and the new one).

    I just do the last step of merge sort on both arrays and save it as sortedFeed.
    
    n=whole feed
    m=sub feed
    re-sorting the whole feed every time I make a new sub feed would take O(nlogn),
    while this way would be just O(n+mlogm)
